However, a large \nnumber of youths still do not have access to electricity across \nthe country, especially in rural and hard-to-reach areas. The \ngovernment, with support from other stakeholders such as the \nprivate sector, could further lower the costs of connection to the \ngrid and significantly reduce the cost of consumption to enable as \nmany homes as possible to have access to reliable electricity or \nsolar energy which is critical for internet connectivity.\nc. Accessibility to reliable and high-speed internet: The technological \nadvancement in Kenya is quite commendable, and this has been \nmade possible through the partnership of the government and \ntelecommunication companies. The launching of the 5G balloons \nin rural and hard-to-reach areas, the first on the continent, is the \nmost recent achievement. The government should continue to \nencourage, partner, and offer incentives to local and international \ntelecommunication companies to deepen internet connection or \nimprove signals especially in the rural and hard-to-reach areas. \nd.

However, focus on supporting \nonly the ones admitted through the Kenya Universities and \nColleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS) has resulted in the \nexclusion of other learners. Therefore, the policies in TVET funding \nthrough HELB should be enhanced to include all learners in TVET \ninstitutions in Kenya, and not only the ones admitted through Kenya \nUniversities and Colleges Central Placement Service (KUCCPS). \nWhere possible, the funding should be differentiated to take into \naccount the nature of the courses. In addition, the costs of courses \ncould be further reduced to allow even the neediest to access \nrelevant education and programmes including the acquisition of \nthe 4IR skills.\nf. Design and deliver new curricula with a core 4IR technology: The \nreview of curricula has opened avenues to make sure that learners \ntrain on skills that are required by the market. The Directorate of \nTVET (DTVET) should continue to integrate key 4IR skills that will \nguarantee the realization of the Kenya Vision 2030.

Therefore, revitalizing, \nstreamlining and increasing resource allocation to vocational centres \ncan be crucial in attracting this group of youth to acquire the skills \nnecessary to create, through entrepreneurship or salaried employment. \nThis could reduce the percentage of Youth NEET in the country. TVET \nstakeholders, especially the MoE, the State Department of Vocational \nand Technical Training (VTT), the County Governments and TVETA will \nneed to come up with support channels and a framework that is inclusive \nof Youth NEET. This is possible since their key characteristics are now \nknown: majority  have secondary level of education, some have only \nprimary level while a few have university education. They live mainly \nin the rural areas where majority of the VTCs are located.
